I‚Äôve kept timelines as low as reasonably possible and pointed the freelancer to the exact files/code so they can replicate without guessing.\n\n---\n\n# Upwork Brief ‚Äî Implement 3 UI updates (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)\n\n## Overview\n\nWe‚Äôre updating our marketing site with three UI changes. All designs, tokens, and example code are provided. Your job is to implement the pages/components to match the provided references with pixel-level care, responsive behavior, and basic accessibility.\n\n## Tech stack\n\n* Next.js (App Router preferred), TypeScript\n* Tailwind CSS (arbitrary values enabled)\n* shadcn/ui (Button, Card)\n* lucide-react (icons)\n\nIf your boilerplate differs, please note and plan minimal mappings to match tokens (colors, radius 16px, shadows) and global background.\n\n## What you‚Äôll build (3 items)\n\n1. **Feature Group page (‚ÄúOperations‚Äù)**\n   Build a new page from the provided handoff (hero left text / right image, alternating media/text rows, teal ‚ÄúAsk a Question‚Äù band with **invert-on-hover**, and ‚ÄúExplore Other Features‚Äù chips + dynamic blurb + example cards).\n\n   * Spec & full Next.js page code are provided in our **Developer Handoff ‚Äî Feature Group Page (Operations)** doc (we‚Äôll share this file in the repo; includes tokens, layout, accessibility notes, and the full `page.tsx` implementation).\n\n2. **Features page (final modern version)**\n   Ensure our features page matches the provided finalized HTML (hero, CTA, six feature cards with mini icons, teal ‚ÄúAsk a Question‚Äù hover invert, filter chips + blurbs + example cards). The file has working CSS and structure‚Äîreplicate it in our Next.js codebase (Tailwind/shadcn) and align tokens. \n\n3. **Landing header with Mega Menu**\n   Implement the sticky header + **mega menu** exactly like the provided React/Tailwind example (hover to open ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù and ‚ÄúSolutions‚Äù panels, gradient aside, clean typography, and button set on the right). Port the markup/behavior into our header component. \n\n## Provided assets & references (all you need)\n\n* **Features Page (Final, standalone HTML)** ‚Äî use as visual & structural truth and port to our stack. \n* **Landing Page ‚Äî Mega Menu (React + Tailwind demo)** ‚Äî copy behavior/structure into our header. \n* **Feature Group (Operations) Handoff** ‚Äî tokens, spacing, background gradient method (banding-proof), accessibility, and **full page code** to drop into `app/(marketing)/operations/page.tsx`.\n\n  * Headings `#1F2975`, body `#433FA3`, primary CTA `#A98BFF` (hover `#8F73FF`), teal `#48A9A6`, radius 16px, shadows (sm/md/lg).\n  * Fixed **full-viewport gradient + radials** as two **fixed** layers so the background is even edge-to-edge.\n  * Ask button hover **inverts** (white bg + teal text/border).\n\nConfirmation: between the two attached files and the handoff doc, **everything required to replicate the UI is present** (layout, tokens, interactions, code). No design guesswork is needed.  \n\n## Deliverables\n\n* 3 merged features:\n\n  1. `app/(marketing)/operations/page.tsx` implemented per handoff.\n  2. `app/(marketing)/features/page.tsx` (or equivalent) aligned to the final HTML reference.\n  3. Updated `Header` with mega menu matching the demo.\n* CSS/tokens in Tailwind (no custom frameworks).\n* Wire ‚ÄúAsk a Question‚Äù to a placeholder link or modal trigger (no backend needed).\n* Replace placeholder images with provided files/paths; use `next/image` where appropriate.\n* Light analytics stubs (optional): console events for CTA, chip clicks, card clicks.\n\n## Acceptance criteria (quick QA)\n\n* **Visual parity** with references at 320, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440 px.\n* Background gradient continuous top‚Üíbottom (no banding/‚Äústop‚Äù at scroll).\n* Buttons & chips match colors and **hover states** (teal invert on Ask).\n* Chips update `aria-selected`; example cards filter by category; blurb updates.\n* Cards uniform heights; subtle hover elevation.\n* Alternating rows align cleanly at lg+, stack at sm.\n* Basic a11y: alt text, focus states intact, readable contrast.\n* Works in latest Chrome/Safari/Firefox.\n\n\n\n## Handover\n\n* PR(s) with clean commits and brief README notes (what changed, where tokens live, how to update blurbs/cards).\n* Light comments in code near the gradient layers and chip logic.\n\n## How to apply\n\n* Share 2‚Äì3 links to production Next.js + Tailwind work (preferably marketing/landing pages with mega menus).","skills":["WordPress Landing Page","Web Design","WordPress","Next.js","Tailwind UI"],"projectType":"fixed","experienceLevel":"Intermediate","duration":"","budget":null,"hourly":null,"postedAt":"4 days ago","proposals":"5 to 10","connectsRequired":null,"client":{"country":"Australia","paymentVerified":true,"rating":0,"totalSpent":"$8K+","hires":0,"jobsPosted":0},"pageNumber":12,"extractedAt":"2025-09-01T18:45:07.684Z"}

You've been doing this for a while, and you know what you're capable of. You're tired of cold calls, unqualified leads, and a compensation plan that doesn't reward your hustle.\n\nWhat if there was a role where the leads are piping hot, ready to buy, and the only limit on your income is your own drive?\n\nThat's exactly what we're offering. We're a fast-growing company that provides high-value educational services, and we're looking for a few top-tier closers to join our team. We don't just want employees; we want partners who will thrive in a flexible, high-reward environment.\n\nWhy You'll Want to Work With Us\nWork from Anywhere: All you need is a laptop, a great headset, and a quiet space. No camera required. This is a dream for anyone who values freedom and flexibility.\n\nComplete Flexibility: You set your own hours. Whether you want to work full-time or part-time, morning or night, it's entirely up to you.\n\nThe Leads are on Fire: We're not talking about lukewarm inquiries. These are pre-qualified, inbound leads who are already expecting your call and are ready to buy. Our current team is closing at a 40-60% conversion rate. You only need 20% to qualify for bonuses.\n\nUncapped Earning Potential: This is where things get interesting. We pay a competitive base hourly rate of $20 - $35/hour, but the real money is in the commissions. You earn a 5% commission on every sale‚Äîthat's $125+ per deal.\n\nExponential Commission Growth: This isn't your average commission structure. Our service can be purchased as a flat $2,500 payment or in five monthly payments of $555. With the monthly payment option, you get 5% of each installment. That means your commission earnings from previous months stack up, allowing you to build a substantial passive income stream. Close just three deals a day on the monthly plan, and within five months, you could be earning over $9,400 per month in commissions alone, on top of your hourly rate.\n\nThe Role in a Nutshell\nYou'll handle pre-scheduled inbound phone consultations with warm leads.\n\nInitially, calls are scheduled for 45 minutes, but top closers can land the deal in 20-25 minutes. After a month, you'll move to 30-minute call slots, potentially taking 16+ calls a day with 8 hours of availability.\n\nMaster our proven sales script while adding your personal touch to build trust quickly and authentically.\n\nLog your calls and follow up professionally.\n\nContinuously improve your skills and strive to hit and exceed your KPIs.\n\nWho We‚Äôre Looking For\nA true closer: You have 1-2+ years of experience in inbound sales, preferably in a high-ticket environment (education, coaching, SaaS). You don't need hand-holding.\n\nScript-savvy: You can quickly internalize a script and make it your own.\n\nRelatable & Trustworthy: You're a great listener and can build rapport in minutes.\n\nDriven: You're hungry for success and motivated by uncapped earning potential.\n\nReady to Change Your Life?\nIf you‚Äôre ready to get off the cold-call grind and step into a role where your hard work directly translates into massive financial freedom, apply now. We're hiring three closers this week who are ready to hit the ground running.\n\nHow to Apply (Please Follow Exactly):\nStart your message with \"I Close Inbound.\"\n\nShare your recent sales numbers (close rate, average deal size, monthly volume) in three bullet points.\n\nRecord a brief video (45-90 seconds) using a tool like Loom. Introduce yourself and tell us why you'd be a great fit for our team.\n\nConfirm you can quickly memorize scripts and list your availability within our open hours of 9am - 9pm Central Time.\n\nList the CRMs and calendaring tools you‚Äôve used (e.g., HubSpot, Close, GHL, Calendly) and your proficiency level.\n\nDo you have what it takes to land hot leads and build a six-figure income from home? We're excited to find out.","skills":["Sales"],"projectType":"hourly","experienceLevel":"Expert","duration":"30+ hrs/week","budget":null,"hourly":null,"postedAt":"6 days ago","proposals":"Less than 5","connectsRequired":null,"client":{"country":"United States","paymentVerified":true,"rating":5,"totalSpent":"$90K+","hires":0,"jobsPosted":0},"pageNumber":23,"extractedAt":"2025-09-01T18:46:22.076Z"}
